//* This is a oneline comment. In one line comment, we have to use two forward slash to make this command.
/* This is a multiple line comment. There are two types of comment here. One is Single line
comment and another is Multiple line comment. In Multiple Line Comment, We have to use One forward slash, then one star
and again one star and a forward slash at the end. */

//*TODO Remember
//? Single line comment was created by C++. It's use in C programming is technically invalid, but some compilers will accept it.
//! In C, you can't have one comment within another comment.Because, It will be a syntax error.
