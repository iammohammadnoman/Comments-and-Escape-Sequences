//? Horizontal Tab Character = \t
//? Vertical Tab Character = \v
//? Double Quotation Mark = \"
//? Single Quotation Mark = \'
//? Backslash = \\ 
//? (Alert)Bell = \a
//? Backspace = \b
//? Form Feed = \f
//? Carriage Return = \r
//? Null Character = \0
//? Question Mark = \?

//** They're generally worked as output function. */
